# 12 Charts of Christmas

### 1/12
First #Trump presidency ranked 4th on #SP500 performance. Now he is tracking 8th so far. 

There has only been one president since 1980s whose time in office (across both terms) left the stock market lower than where it started.

US #tariffs did little damage to China's overall #trade. Transshipping and the fact that direct exports to the US make up only one-tenth of China's total cushioned the blow. 

The pressure is building up though, just not in the volumes. 

As China pushes more aggressively into new and existing markets, price competition gets even more intense. Chinese producers continue to face deflationary pressure both at home and in their export markets.

#AI needs data centers. And #DataCenters need electricity. A lot of it. 

US households are already feeling the squeeze – average residential #electricity prices were 7.4% higher in September 2025 from a year ago. 

The US has nearly 5,000 data centers. Business Insider tracks about 1,200 of the largest ones – big enough to need backup generators. In #Virginia, those facilities account for around 7.5% of all electricity generated in the state.

Staying on #AI – there’s just too much to show.

The big AI jumps are likely behind us, for now. I certainly hope so – it has been too much to catch up to! Recent #model releases have been incremental advances, often focused on cost and efficiency. There is no longer a leading player: models have pretty much converged, and AI is starting to look more like a commodity. 

Now it is all about integrating more of it into our daily lives. 

Google was late to the GPT AI boom, long enough that #ChatGPT briefly became a go-to search tool. Now Google's AI is pulling users back, with Gemini, which tops the ranks for the first time, integrated to the search, Pixel phones, and wider Google ecosystem.

OpenAI still managed to solidify its lead with nearly (that's what Google says) a billion weekly active users thanks to its first-mover advantage. 

#Data and benchmark heavy lifting by Artificial Analysis.

Still on #AI. A new paper suggests that since the rise of #ChatGPT, wages have come under pressure.

It’s an early piece of research, digging through new and massive worker–firm data, and it will have to stand up to robust review.

But for now, it paints a reasonable (and not all positive) picture:

 𝟭. 𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝘆: Starting wages in AI-exposed firms show ~5% gap compared with less-exposed peers.

 𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝘂𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗿: Juniors are being “pushed up” into mid-level roles, swelling the supply in the middle and dragging pay down for all.

 𝟯. “𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗽 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲” 𝘃𝘀 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: As AI takes on more complex cognitive tasks, job requirements are starting to evolve – formal education taking the hit.

Fresh off the press from World Inequality Lab.

I will just leave you with this quote and chart: "The world's top 10% richest individuals own 3/4 of everything there is to own on Planet Earth. While the bottom 50% that is 4 billion individuals own just 2% of the total."

The #demographic cliff is closing in for many nations.

Canada has long leaned on #immigration – nearly 1 in 4 Canadians is foreign-born. But as more countries age, competition for “people” will likely intensify.

At the same time, Canadians are taking longer to settle down, and are having fewer kids. And we are about to feel the squeeze from the coming #boomer retirement wave – one that will add strain to healthcare, labour markets, and social security systems.

If you had to name 2025 in three words, #crypto would come right after trade and AI.

#Bitcoin's market value swung by a trillion dollars this year. And while gold kept climbing, bitcoin fell – prompting fresh questions about the “digital gold” narrative.

But the bigger story was #stablecoins. They’re part of the crypto world – but not in the way you know it. Stablecoins aren’t decentralized, and are mostly backed 1:1 by liquid assets, adding stability by design.
 
The upside is real. Stablecoins could help remove friction from global payments – especially faster, cheaper cross-border transfers. And the biggest gains may be in financial inclusion, where access to banking is limited, and some countries even tried phone-banking before.

The risks are real too. This is another layer of financial engineering on top of an already complex system – and complexity likely to hit less sophisticated users. Add the challenge of tracking illicit activities, and the stakes rise quickly.

#debasement trade – add this phrase to the 2025 tally. 

#Tariffs + #uncertainty = money pushed to safe havens. #Bitcoin failed to cement its place among the likes of gold. #Gold and #silver, on the other hand, have kept climbing up defying many analyst calls. 

Robin Brooks has a must-read Substack on debasement trade and more.

Climate economic modelling in many ways is still a black box of 'things' going in, and 'things' coming out. An academic paper that fed into parts of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) modelling was retracted a couple weeks ago, in case you didn't hear the news. 

But the culprit this time was good ol' friend GDP. #EconomicData for Uzbekistan was inaccurate in the database. Single country data error led to 3X overestimation of the damages. 

High-emissions scenario – a world with 5-6°C by 2100 – would see ~60% drop in GDP, in the version with the error. Other papers have put the tally at ~20%. These conclusions can have a major impact on how we think about #mitigation and #adaptation – both speed and magnitude.

On graph:
a. Shows the discrepancy in the GDP from the database used in the report vs The World Bank estimates
b. Shows the impact of temperature with and excluding #Uzbekistan from the analysis
c. Shows the final #GDP impact also with and without country with error.
